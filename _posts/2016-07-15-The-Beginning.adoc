= The Beginning
:hp-tags: My Story

One of my earliest memories of what would later be considered "gender-fluid" was running out my cousin's bedroom wearing her leotard-with-tutu and calling out to the family "When you pass this down, can I have it?". I was laughed out of the room. 

I was ashamed that I had done something wrong, but I didn't know what I had done. Tutus were apparently off limits to me, despite the fact that clothes were definitely handed down from my older sister to my older cousins. I thought that meant that I could be next in line for the sparkly-pink thing. Culture, more than any single person, told me that I couldn't have what I wanted.
